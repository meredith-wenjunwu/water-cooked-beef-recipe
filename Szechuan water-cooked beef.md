3. Drain the water and find a bowl or a small pot to put the vegetables in.

4. If your beef slice is really thin, no need to marinate. Just cook it like shabu shabu (don't overcook). If it's somewhat a little thick, you can marinate for about 15 min with oil, an egg, 2 tsp of soysauce, some sugar, salt,  2 tbsp of corn starch and some white pepper. Again, cook it like shabu shabu and put it on top of the vegetables.

5. Heat your wok, put some oil. I usually wait till the point that I put my hand about 2 fist away I can feel the heat but not burning. Then, add szechuan pepper, and switch to medium heat. Fry till you can smell the scent from those peppers. 

   Here, I throw them out, but you could leave them there. 

4. Then, put in garlic slices, ginger and the white part of the green onion. Fry till you can the garlic turning gold but not brown.
